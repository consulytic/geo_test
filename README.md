## geopandas experiments ##

---
The environment has been set up, using miniconda to:
- create the geo_env environment
- install all geopandas with all of its pre-requisites
- install Jupyter Notebooks & Labs
- set up git with remote on github.com

*Despite installing using conda, Jupyter Notebook through an error about tbb.so.lib, so I installed it manually. Also, for the Alberta ED Map to plot, I needed the Descartes library.*
